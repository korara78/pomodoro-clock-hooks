# Pomodoro-Clock-Hooks

## Overview

Pomodoro Clock (aka 5 + 25 clock) app. This app allows the user to set a timer into seperate intervals. By default there is a 25-minute session with 5-minute breaks. The user may adjust the sessions and break times as needed. I used an mp3 file to produce the alarm beep and which will reset once the coiuntdown reaches zero.  

Based on the Freecodecamp.org projects towards the Front End Development Libraries Certification.

The Freecodecamp.org curriculum only covered the use of class components in React. This is my version utilizing the React Hooks (useState) for expanded educational purposes. 

## Styling

I used the Materialize framework to access icons such as the pause and plays buttons as well as the arrows buttons. I leveraged a CSS grid display layout to nest two sub containers (break and session) within their parent container.
